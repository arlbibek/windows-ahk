Do you often find yourself repeating small, tedious tasks — like switching between apps, copying text, pasting it into a browser to search, checking the calendar just to type today’s date, changing text cases, or typing the same responses over and over? This script attempts to eliminate those micro-frustrations by automating repetitive actions.

## 🚀 Features

Here are some of the features WINDOWS-AHK offers:

- 🔄 Application switcher: Launch or toggle between apps using function keys (customizable).
- 📁 File Explorer power-shortcuts: Instantly Open file explorer or navigate to folders like Downloads, Music, or open VS Code in the current directory.
- 🧠 Hotstrings & snippets: Type /date, /addr, etc., to expand text dynamically.
- 🔤 Text case transformers: Change selected text to uppercase, lowercase, or title case instantly.
- 🔍 Quick search: Search any selected text directly in your browser.
- 🖥️ Presentation mode: Toggle Windows Presentation Mode on/off.
- 🧩 Customizable: Change actions, hotkeys, and text expansions via configuration file — no code needed!

## 📖 Usage

```plaintext
CAUTION!
THESE SCRIPTS TEND TO BE VERY ADDICTIVE.
```

### Option 1

✅ _Recommended_

1. Download the `WINDOWS_AHK.exe` from the latest [releases](https://github.com/arlbibek/windows-ahk/releases).
2. Run the `WINDOWS_AHK.exe` file. Done!

> **Please note:** You are likely to encounter a **Windows SmartScreen warning** when launching `windows_ahk.exe` for the first time.
> This is a common behavior for executables that aren't digitally signed or widely downloaded.
>
> To proceed: Click **"More info"** on the warning screen. Then click **"Run anyway"**.

### Option 2

☑️ _Ideal for users who prefer not to run `.exe` files or want to tweak the script_

1. Download and install AutoHotKey v2 from [autohotkey.com/download](https://www.autohotkey.com/download).
2. Clone this repository and navigate to the `windows-ahk/` directory.
